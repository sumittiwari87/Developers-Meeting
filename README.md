`server.js`

This example show that how to create a sample web site using `express.js`,`node.js`,`angular.js`,`gulp.js`,`bower.js`,`Dynamic CSS using SASS` , ` A good design using reusable CSS componenets `, `material design concepts`. 

In this example I have created one web site


## Code Example

To run the code please go to main directory and you will find two folders name `front-end` and `back-end`. The `front-end contains all the code related to clients using angular framework. The `back-end` folders conatins all the code related to the server, routes and reading JSON file using `node` and `express`

## Motivation

This is just an example to showcase the power of `express.js`,`node.js`,`angular.js`,`gulp.js`,`bower.js`,`Dynamic CSS using SASS` , ` A good design using reusable CSS componenets `, `material design concepts` together.

Go to the web browser and open the `http://localhost:5000/` 

## API Reference

This is just a sample app. See the two folder structures.

## Tests

To test the services I will recommand you to use `postman` installed in your chrome browser, if not please add the `postman` application from chrome web.

use postman to test all your services in `back-end` folder.

To test the front I will integrate the `jasmine` or `protactor` using ` karma - server ` in future
